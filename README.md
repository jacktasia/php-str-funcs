# PHP String Functions in Emacs Lisp

## About

In the process of creating all the [php string functions](http://php.net/manual/en/ref.strings.php) in [Emacs Lisp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs_Lisp) for fun. Also I think it may be an interesting way to learn Emacs Lisp for people who are more familiar with PHP (which I would think would be most).
